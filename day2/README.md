## Today I've done the following:

## Task1 :: Created and pre-configured Virtual Machine in Google cloud by the following ways:
### - gcp-ui
### - gcloud
### - terraform (all settings are provided via variables (tfvars), and URL (“http://IP. Address/” is printed to output )

## Task2 :: Updated terraform configuration to add a drive to nginx-tf instance via terraform
